# How to run 
The following project was implemented in a .Net Core environment, to run it itâ€™s possible to use two options. 
Using Visual Studio 2022, update the Nuget Packages and then compile and run the project.
A second option is to run the dotnet run command in the command window (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run)
The system will open a swagger interface where you can interact with the different services. Or you can use postman to the local url (https://localhost:7285) to access the endpoints.
